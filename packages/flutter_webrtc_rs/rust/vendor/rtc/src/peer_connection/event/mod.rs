//! WebRTC peer connection event types.
//!
//! This module defines all events that can be emitted by an `RTCPeerConnection`
//! according to the WebRTC specification. These events notify applications about
//! state changes, incoming media tracks, data channels, ICE candidates, and errors.
//!
//! # Sans-I/O Event Pattern
//!
//! This crate uses a sans-I/O design where events are polled from the peer connection
//! rather than delivered via callbacks. Applications drive the event loop by calling
//! `poll_event()` and handling the returned events.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Basic event loop pattern
//!
//! `poll_event()`, `poll_timeout()` and `handle_timeout()` come from the
//! [`sansio::Protocol`] implementation on [`RTCPeerConnection`](crate::peer_connection::RTCPeerConnection),
//! so that trait must be in
//! scope to call them.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use rtc::peer_connection::RTCPeerConnectionBuilder;
//! use rtc::peer_connection::configuration::RTCConfigurationBuilder;
//! use rtc::peer_connection::event::RTCPeerConnectionEvent;
//! use rtc::sansio::Protocol;
//! use std::time::Instant;
//!
//! # fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let config = RTCConfigurationBuilder::new().build();
//! let mut peer_connection = RTCPeerConnectionBuilder::new()
//!     .with_configuration(config)
//!     .build(Instant::now())?;
//!
//! loop {
//!     // Poll and handle events
//!     while let Some(event) = peer_connection.poll_event() {
//!         match event {
//!             RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnIceCandidateEvent(ice_event) => {
//!                 println!("New ICE candidate");
//!                 // Send candidate to remote peer via signaling
//!             }
//!             RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnTrack(_track_event) => {
//!                 println!("New track received");
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//!
//!     // Handle timeouts
//!     if let Some(timeout) = peer_connection.poll_timeout() {
//!         if timeout <= Instant::now() {
//!             peer_connection.handle_timeout(Instant::now())?;
//!         }
//!     }
//!     
//!     break; // Exit for example
//! }
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Handling connection state changes
//!
//! ```
//! use rtc::peer_connection::event::RTCPeerConnectionEvent;
//! use rtc::peer_connection::state::RTCPeerConnectionState;
//!
//! # fn handle_events(event: RTCPeerConnectionEvent) {
//! match event {
//!     RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnConnectionStateChangeEvent(state) => {
//!         match state {
//!             RTCPeerConnectionState::Connected => {
//!                 println!("Peer connection established!");
//!             }
//!             RTCPeerConnectionState::Failed => {
//!                 println!("Connection failed - cleanup required");
//!             }
//!             RTCPeerConnectionState::Disconnected => {
//!                 println!("Connection lost - may reconnect");
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//!     _ => {}
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Handling data channels
//!
//! ```
//! use rtc::peer_connection::event::{RTCPeerConnectionEvent, RTCDataChannelEvent};
//!
//! # fn handle_events(event: RTCPeerConnectionEvent) {
//! match event {
//!     RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnDataChannel(dc_event) => {
//!         match dc_event {
//!             RTCDataChannelEvent::OnOpen(channel_id) => {
//!                 println!("Data channel opened: {:?}", channel_id);
//!             }
//!             RTCDataChannelEvent::OnClose(channel_id) => {
//!                 println!("Data channel closed: {:?}", channel_id);
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//!     _ => {}
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Handling incoming tracks
//!
//! ```
//! use rtc::peer_connection::event::{RTCPeerConnectionEvent, RTCTrackEvent};
//!
//! # fn handle_events(event: RTCPeerConnectionEvent) {
//! match event {
//!     RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnTrack(track_event) => {
//!         match track_event {
//!             RTCTrackEvent::OnOpen(init) => {
//!                 println!("Track opened with receiver: {:?}", init.receiver_id);
//!             }
//!             _ => {}
//!         }
//!     }
//!     _ => {}
//! }
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Event Types
//!
//! - **Negotiation**: [`OnNegotiationNeededEvent`](RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnNegotiationNeededEvent) - Signals need for renegotiation
//! - **ICE**: [`OnIceCandidateEvent`](RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnIceCandidateEvent) - New ICE candidate available
//! - **ICE Error**: [`OnIceCandidateErrorEvent`](RTCPeerConnectionEvent::OnIceCandidateErrorEvent) - ICE gathering error
