# rtcp-processing

rtcp-processing demonstrates the Public API for processing RTCP packets in sansio RTC.

## What is RTCP?

RTCP (RTP Control Protocol) is a companion protocol to RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol). While RTP carries the actual
media data, RTCP provides out-of-band statistics and control information for an RTP session:

- **Sender Reports (SR)**: Statistics from media senders (packets sent, bytes sent, timestamps)
- **Receiver Reports (RR)**: Reception quality feedback (packet loss, jitter, round-trip time)
- **Source Description (SDES)**: Identifies the source (CNAME, email, phone, etc.)
- **Goodbye (BYE)**: Indicates a source is leaving the session
- **Application-specific (APP)**: Custom application data
- **Feedback messages**: PLI, FIR, NACK, REMB, etc. for congestion control and quality

## How It Works

1. Paste a base64-encoded SDP offer from a browser
2. The example creates an answer and outputs it as base64
3. Paste the answer in the browser to establish the connection
4. As media flows, RTCP packets are received and printed in human-readable format

## Reading inbound RTCP

**Important:** by default, inbound RTCP is consumed by the interceptor chain (for generating statistics, NACK
responses, congestion control, etc.) and does **not** reach the application via `poll_read()`. It is control traffic
the interceptors act on, not media the application asked for.

To see it, put an interceptor in the chain that attaches `Attribute::DeliverToApplication` to the packets you want.
The terminus that ends the inbound RTCP path passes those through, and they arrive from `poll_read()` alongside the
media. The choice is per-packet: an SFU relaying keyframe requests marks those and leaves alone the receiver reports
its own chain is already acting on.

```rust
// `DeliverRtcp` is this example's own interceptor: it marks inbound RTCP so the terminus lets it past.
// Application-ward of everything the default chain registers, so those have acted on the packet first.
let builder = Registry::new().with(Slot::from(14_000), DeliverRtcp::default());

// Register default interceptors (NACK, reports, TWCC, etc.)
let registry = register_default_interceptors(builder, & mut media_engine) ?;

let config = RTCConfigurationBuilder::new()
.with_interceptor_registry(registry)
.build();
```

It has to be asked for when the chain is built rather than arranged by an interceptor of your own. A chain is a flat
list walked from the wire towards the application, and what an interceptor emits from `poll_read` rejoins that list
*behind* itself — where the stage that ends the inbound RTCP path is still ahead of it, and drops the original and the
copy both.

## Using with Browser

1. Open a WebRTC demo page that can send video (e.g., the broadcast example's HTML page)
2. Run this example
3. Paste the offer from the browser
4. Paste the answer back into the browser
5. Watch RTCP packets being logged as media flows

## API Usage

With a marking interceptor on the chain, RTCP packets become available via `poll_read()`:

```rust
while let Some(message) = peer_connection.poll_read() {
match message {
RTCMessage::RtcpPacket(track_id, rtcp_packets) => {
for packet in rtcp_packets {
// Get header info
let header = packet.header();
println! ("Type: {:?}", header.packet_type);

// Display full packet (implements Display trait)
println! ("{}", packet);
}
}
_ => {}
}
}
```

**Note:** Without an interceptor marking packets with `Attribute::DeliverToApplication`, you will **not** receive
`RTCMessage::RtcpPacket` messages — inbound RTCP is consumed internally by the interceptor chain.

Marking is the mechanism because a copy cannot outrun the terminus: a chain is a flat list, and what an interceptor
emits from `poll_read` rejoins that list *behind* itself, where the terminus is still ahead of it. A marked packet
finishes the walk normally and the terminus reads the mark.

## Sending RTCP Packets

To send RTCP packets (e.g., PLI for keyframe requests):

```rust
use rtc::rtcp::payload_feedbacks::picture_loss_indication::PictureLossIndication;

if let Some( mut receiver) = peer_connection.rtp_receiver(receiver_id) {
receiver.write_rtcp(vec ! [Box::new(PictureLossIndication {
sender_ssrc: 0,
media_ssrc: track_ssrc,
})]) ?;
}
```
