Additional utilities and helpers for working with [firebridge](https://pub.dev/packages/firebridge). Forked from nyxx_extensions to provide support for user accounts.

While the main [firebridge](https://pub.dev/packages/firebridge) package focuses on providing a wrapper only for the features described in [Discord's developer documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), this package contains a collection of commonly used functions and plugins when making Discord bots, such as [pagination](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx_extensions/latest/nyxx_extensions/Pagination-class.html), [sanitization](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx_extensions/latest/nyxx_extensions/sanitizeContent.html) or [endpoint pagination](https://pub.dev/documentation/nyxx_extensions/latest/search.html?q=stream).

## Other nyxx packages
